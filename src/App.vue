            We must be quiet, soft and gentle. The man who does the best job is
            the one who is happy at his job. These little son of a guns hide in
            your brush and you just have to push them out. We'll put all the
            little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Maybe
            there's a little something happening right here. I started painting
            as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I
            believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.
            Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it
            should be. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and
            animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. You
            are only limited by your imagination. You can't make a mistake.
            Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something
            beautiful out of it.
